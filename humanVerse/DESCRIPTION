Description: Making R more palatable and extensible.  With a "git r done" mentality, the objective is to maximize productivity while minimizing interruptivity through the extensibility of the *AMAZING WARP CORE* that is R.  Let's do more than "git back to base", let's evolve.  Remember how modern R 'felt' in 2004:  the ability to automate statistical analyses using custom functions, the ability to download packages automatically within RGUI, extensible base plotting features with color support, cutting-edge use of localhost CGI serving help pages, ... and so on ...  This library (optionally paired with its cousins: HVcpp and [TBD: HVc]) aims to create an API layer of BASE-R to allow for a 'modern' web-based application to be developed:  Sophia.  Sophia will have several important modules named in homage to 'oldschool' *AMAZING WARP CORE* technologies that were great: Cairn [a la WordPerfect 5.1/5.2], Lotus-V [Lotus 1-2-3], Chatty [chat rooms: IRC, CompuServe, AOL to SKYPE/VIBER/Telegram/WhatsApp/ZOOM], Nappy [Napster {encode/decode A/V}, Streaming ... Spotify, Youtube?], Carmen [whereis 'Carmen SanDiego': is this Mappy: openstreets/Google Earth], Sphinx [file management, search engine, dictionary access {1828/1844/1913; Urban; Guarani 1600, Egyptian 1800}, and so on], Maria [whenis: calendar/planner/scheduler time and date management Franklin/Covey], Floppy [content sharing: Dropbox, Drives, NextCloud, OwnCloud], Angie [hosting: Angelfire, Geocities], Slacker [Reddit / SO / Quora / Chegg => Cheff => Che-LOCO], Sparrow [Pirate themed], and Iris [Homage to Horticulturalist/RA a la Photoshop 6.0].  TWELVE modules, feels correct!  Built on DAMP:  Debian, Apache, MariaDB [mysql], and PHP (localhost or deployed) with git version control (gitlabs?) and powered by R.  All for the low cost of FREE-99-FOREVER.  No ads, no interruptions, ever.  It is time!
