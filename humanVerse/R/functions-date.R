# SI defintions: meter, kg, etc. 
# https://www.npl.co.uk/si-units/metre
# The metre is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum, ùí∏, to be 299 792 458 when expressed in the unit m s‚àí1, where the second is defined in terms of the caesium frequency ‚àÜŒΩ. The wording of the definition was updated in 2019. (https://www.npl.co.uk/si-units/metre)
# The metre was initially defined as one ten-millionth of the distance on the Earth's surface from the north pole to the equator, on a line passing through Paris. Expeditions from 1792 to 1799 determined this length by measuring the distance from Dunkirk to Barcelona, with an accuracy of about 0.02%
# In 1848‚Äì49, physicist Hippolyte Fizeau measured the speed of light using a rotating cogwheel. In 2009, NPL and the BBC used a kitchen blender to recreate Fizeau‚Äôs experiment
# The exact coordinates of the Great Pyramid of Giza are 29.9792458¬∞N which by itself means very little. However, some enthusiasts have noticed the number is exactly the same as the speed of light which travels at 299,792,458 metres per second. (https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/960740/ancient-egypt-great-pyramid-giza-speed-of-light) ... SNOPES involved, so likely TRUE (https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pyramid-location-speed-light/):  It is true that the latitude 29.9792458 N intersects the Great Pyramid of Giza (at the selected longitude of around 31.134667 E). However:
# A prime meridian is an arbitrary meridian (a line of longitude) in a geographic coordinate system at which longitude is defined to be 0¬∞. 
# In October 1884 the Greenwich Meridian was selected by delegates (forty-one delegates representing twenty-five nations) to the International Meridian Conference held in Washington, D.C., United States to be the common zero of longitude and standard of time reckoning throughout the world.
