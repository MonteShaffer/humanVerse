# Hello Friend
This notebook will do a basic walkthrough on how to get up-and-running on the humanVerse.

## Welcome to R::humanVerse
The `humanVerse` is `R-base` friendly, very few dependencies here.  The objective is to make `R` more accessible by evolving its language to align with `C-based` standards.  I program in several C-based languages, and I want to minimize my `cognitive load` while maximizing my efficiency.  A few wrapper functions will make that so.

## include-setup.R

This one file has all the basic functions we need to load more functions or (of course) you can load the library.  

There are `misc` functions outside the library that run content-specific activities that do not belong in the main library as they include a lot of extraneous libraries.  For example, `functions-nlp.R` is well worth your time, please check it out.


```{r}
